			<p>A <strong>video game</strong> is an <em>electronic game</em> that involves interaction 
			with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device 
			such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word video in video game 
			traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, 
			it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional 
			images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation 
			is controversial.</p>

			<p>Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. 
			The earliest example is from 1947â€”a "Cathode ray tube Amusement Device" 
			was filed for a patent on 25 January 1947, by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. 
			and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992.
			[1] Inspired by radar display technology, it consisted of an analog device 
			that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a 
			missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.[2] Other 
			early examples include: The Nimrod computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain; OXO a 
			tic-tac-toe Computer game by Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952; Tennis 
			for Two, an electronic interactive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958; 
			Spacewar!, written by MIT students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's 
			on a DEC PDP-1 computer in 1961; and the hit ping pong-style Pong, a 1972 game by
			Atari. Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights to 
			play the game of Nim,[3] OXO used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe[4] Tennis
			for Two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court,[2] and Spacewar! used the DEC 
			PDP-1's vector display to have two spaceships battle each other.[5]</p>
